# How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Uninstall Vencord if you have it installed already (this will make a custom install for it)
3. Run start.bat as **Administrator**, If you feel this is sketchy, check the source code yourself
4. Wait for setup to finish and install Vencord (you can also install OpenAsar).
